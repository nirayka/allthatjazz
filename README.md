## About The Project
_All That Jazz_ is an app built out of necessity, to be frank. Carrying around and navigating a 3-lb 462-page book is not any musician's idea of fun. If you'd like a more in-depth description, read [this](https://nirayka.github.io/allthatjazz/about.html).

### Built With
The meat and potatoes of the site are of course HTML and CSS. The web app uses [JavaScript](https://javascript.com) in conjunction with [JQuery](https://jquery.com).

## Getting Started / Usage
Just visit [All That Jazz](https://nirayka.github.io/allthatjazz/app.html) to make use of this project!
