  <p>>All that Jazz</em> was created (and continues to be maintained by) Nirayka Monga. She is a 12th grader at the Academy for Information Technology. Her first experience with web design and app development in her required 10th grade computer science course, and she’s been in love ever since. She is currently studying advanced software development, computer art, and database development and programming in her senior year courses. In college, she hopes to study computer science and engineering. Her other personal projects and select problem sets can be found <a href="http://github.com/nirayka" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
  <p>Nirayka is also an experienced pianist, having delved into both classical and jazz music. She’s performed at venues such as Carnegie Hall, and she’s currently a part of the Scotch Plains-Fanwood Moonglowers jazz band and New Jersey All-State Jazz Combo. Her favorite classical composers are Frédéric Chopin and Franz Liszt, and her favorite jazz musicians are Bill Evans, and Chick Corea. She also enjoys albums by Anderson .Paak, Mac Miller, and Thundercat.</p>
  <p>In her free time, Nirayka enjoys trying out new instruments; her recent exploits include the guitar and the accordion. She’s also an avid enjoyer of the Great British Baking Show and tries (often unsuccessfully) to bake along with the technical challenges.</p>
  <p>Nirayka would like to thank Mr. Ryan Wilson for introducing her to computer science, and for his support throughout her high school career. She’d also like to thank Mr. Greg Natic for teaching her nearly everything she knows about jazz, and Mr. Nick Ellis for pushing her to try jazz piano in the first place.</p>
